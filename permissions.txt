INSERT INTO users_permissions
SELECT id, (SELECT id FROM permissions WHERE code = 'grocery:read') FROM users;

(SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'ben@gmail.com'),
(SELECT id FROM permissions WHERE code = 'grocery:write')

FROM permissions
INNER JOIN users_permissions
ON users_permissions.permission_id = permissions.id
INNER JOIN users
ON users_permissions.user_id = users.id
WHERE users.activated = true
GROUP BY email;
